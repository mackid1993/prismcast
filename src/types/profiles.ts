/**
 * Available channel selection strategies. Each strategy implements a different approach to finding and selecting channels in a multi-channel player UI.
 *
 * - "directvGrid": Tune via webpack injection — captures __webpack_require__, extracts the Redux store from the React fiber tree, matches by channel name, and
 *   dispatches playConsumable. Falls back to logo aria-label click when the interceptor fails. Used by DirecTV Stream.
 * - "foxGrid": Find channel by station code in a non-virtualized guide grid, click the channel logo button via DOM .click(). Used by Fox.com.
 * - "guideGrid": Find channel by exact-matching image alt text, click nearest clickable ancestor. Optionally clicks a tab to reveal the list first. Used by Hulu
 *   Live TV.
 * - "hboGrid": Discover the HBO tab page URL from the homepage menu bar, scrape the live channel tile rail for a matching channel name, and navigate to the watch
 *   URL. Caches the tab URL across tunes with stale-cache fallback. Used by HBO Max.
 * - "none": No channel selection needed (single-channel sites). This is the default.
 * - "slingGrid": Find channel by data-testid in a virtualized A-Z guide grid, scroll via binary search on .guide-cell scrollTop, click the on-now program
 *   cell. Used by Sling TV.
 * - "thumbnailRow": Find channel element using the profile's matchSelector (defaults to image URL matching), click adjacent element on the same row. Used by
 *   USA Network.
 * - "tileClick": Find channel element using the profile's matchSelector (defaults to image URL matching), click tile, then optionally click play button if
 *   playSelector is configured. Used by Disney+.
 * - "youtubeGrid": Find channel by aria-label in a non-virtualized EPG grid, extract the watch URL, and navigate directly. Used by YouTube TV.

  listSelector?: string;

  // CSS selector template for finding the channel element on the page. The placeholder {channel} is replaced with the channel's channelSelector value at runtime
  // (e.g., "img[src*=\"{channel}\"]" becomes "img[src*=\"espn\"]"). Supports any valid CSS selector — match by image src, aria-label, data-testid, title, or any
  // other attribute. Used by the tileClick and thumbnailRow strategies. When absent, these strategies default to image URL matching (img[src*="..."]).
  matchSelector?: string;

  // CSS selector for a play button that must be clicked after selecting a channel entry. Some sites show a playback action overlay after channel selection instead
  // of immediately starting playback. When set, this element is waited for and clicked after the channel entry click. Used by the guideGrid and tileClick strategies.
  playSelector?: string;

  // CSS selector to narrow the DOM search when scrollTarget is set. Combined with scrollTarget, the scroll phase queries elements matching this selector and then
  // filters to the one whose textContent matches scrollTarget. Example: "h4" to search only heading elements. Can be overridden per channel.
  scrollSelector?: string;

  // Text content to match when scrolling a lazy-loaded section into view before channel selection. Some sites (e.g., Disney+) lazy-load channel shelves that only
  // render when scrolled into the viewport. When set, the scroll phase finds an element whose textContent matches this string, scrolls it into view, and waits
  // briefly for lazy content to render. Must be used together with scrollSelector. Can be overridden per channel.
  scrollTarget?: string;

  // Whether to scroll to the bottom of the page before channel selection. Some sites (e.g., Disney+) lazy-load entire page sections that only appear in the DOM
  // after scrolling. When true, the page is scrolled to the bottom to force all lazy content to render before the matchSelector poll begins. Can be overridden

/* Site profiles define behavior patterns for different streaming site implementations. Television network streaming sites vary widely in their player
 * implementations: some use keyboard shortcuts for fullscreen, others require the JavaScript Fullscreen API; some embed video in iframes, others place it directly
 * in the page; some auto-mute videos and fight attempts to unmute them. The profile system captures these behavioral differences as configuration rather than
 * code, making it easy to add support for new sites by defining their characteristics.
 *
 * Profiles support inheritance via the "extends" field, allowing common patterns to be defined once and reused. For example, many NBC Universal properties share
 * the same player implementation, so they extend a common "nbcUniversal" base profile.

  // Whether the video player requires a click to start playback. Brightcove-based players commonly require this. When true, the stream handler clicks the video

  // after playback begins. Set to null to disable keyboard fullscreen and rely on CSS-based fullscreen styling instead.
  fullscreenKey?: Nullable<string>;

  // CSS selector for a fullscreen button element to click. When set, this button is clicked before attempting keyboard or API fullscreen methods. This is useful
  // for sites that have a native fullscreen button in their player UI (e.g., a "MAXIMIZE" button). The element is verified to exist before clicking, so toggle
  // buttons that disappear after activation are handled gracefully.
  fullscreenSelector?: Nullable<string>;

  // CSS selector for site-specific overlay elements to hide during capture. When set, a persistent stylesheet is injected into the page that applies
  // "display: none !important" to the matched elements. This is used for player controls, toolbars, or other overlays that remain visible during fullscreen and
  // would otherwise appear in the captured stream. The selector supports standard CSS selector lists (comma-separated for multiple targets).

  // remain unmuted. This is a heavyweight intervention used only when necessary.
  lockVolumeProperties?: boolean;

  // main document. An iframe initialization delay is applied before searching to allow the iframe content to load.

  // pages like electronic program guides or information displays that should be captured as-is without expecting video playback.
  noVideo?: boolean;

  // Whether to select the video element by readyState rather than DOM position. Some pages have multiple video elements (ads, previews, the main content). When
  // true, we find the video with readyState >= 3 (HAVE_FUTURE_DATA) rather than just taking the first video in the DOM. This typically selects the actively
  // playing main content rather than preloaded ad content.
  selectReadyVideo?: boolean;

  // Whether to use the JavaScript Fullscreen API instead of keyboard shortcuts. When true, we call video.requestFullscreen() or use the webkit-prefixed variant.
  // This is more reliable than keyboard shortcuts on some sites but may trigger browser permission prompts or be blocked by site CSP policies.
  useRequestFullscreen?: boolean;

  // Whether to wait for network idle during page navigation. When true, page.goto() waits for the network to be idle (no requests for 500ms) before returning.
