# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.5.1 (2026-03-01)
  * New feature: Spectrum TV provider support inclusive of local affiliates. Thanks to @scottuf for the collaboration.
  * Improvement: added 40+ DirecTV Stream (thanks to @mackid1993) and Sling channel variants (thanks to @bnhf), including local affiliate support for DirecTV Stream.
  * Improvement: webUI refinements - consolidated Quick Actions menu with live toggle counts for predefined channel scopes, bulk provider assignment, and a channel summary showing predefined and user channel breakdown.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.5.0 (2026-02-28)
  * New feature: DirecTV Stream provider support. Thanks to @kineticmac for the collaboration.
  * New feature: sortable columns and optional columns on the channels tab — click any column header to sort, and use the column picker to show or hide Number, Station ID, Profile, and Selector columns. Preferences persist across sessions. **Note: your preferred sort will determine how the playlist is ordered for Channels DVR by default.**
  * New feature: channel health and provider login indicators on the channels tab — green/red dots show last tune status per channel, and provider badges indicate verified authentication.
  * New feature: channel lineup precaching at startup — provider guide data can be optionally fetched in the background so channel discovery is instant on first tune. Precaching only helps speed up the first tune of a channel on a given provider.
  * New feature: bulk actions dropdown on the channels tab for toggling predefined channels by scope — all, Pacific variants only, or East variants only.
  * New feature: user-defined provider profiles — add support for any streaming site without waiting for a built-in update. A step-by-step builder wizard guides you through profile creation, live CSS selector testing verifies your configuration against the real site, and shareable provider packs let you export and import complete provider setups.
  * Improvement: the playlist endpoint now accepts optional `?sort=` and `?direction=` query parameters to override the saved sort order per request without changing the saved preference. Thanks to @bnhf for the inspiration.
  * Improvement: expanded predefined channel coverage across providers, with automatic Pacific timezone variant generation. Thanks to @bnhf for the collaboration.
  * Improvement: detect and fix stale service paths after upgrades — `service start` and `service restart` auto-regenerate the service file when paths change, and `service status` warns about mismatches.
  * Improvement: profile-level scroll options for sites like Disney+ that lazy-load page content.
  * Improvement: webUI performance refinements.
  * Improvement: channel selector autocomplete now suggests all available channels from provider discovery, with fuzzy URL matching and "Did you mean?" hints for common domain variants.
  * Housekeeping: provider optimizations and refinements.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.4.1 (2026-02-20)

## 1.4.0 (2026-02-19)

  * Housekeeping.

## 1.3.3 (2026-02-16)

  * Improvement: refreshed the PrismCast server home page documentation.
  * Improvement: defensively clean up after Chrome on startup and shutdown.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.3.2 (2026-02-15)
  * Improvement: when possible, directly tune URLs for HBO Max, Sling TV, and YouTube TV to skip guide navigation on repeat tunes.
  * Improvement: our stream health monitoring now regularly checks to ensure the stream remains fullscreened, and attempts to correct it if it's not.
  * Improvement: improved MPEG-TS ATSC transport stream compatibility for Plex HDHomeRun integration.
  * Improvement: webUI refinements.
  * Fix: saving settings was wiping the disabled channel list, provider filter, and HDHomeRun device ID.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.3.1 (2026-02-14)
  * Improvement: when channel selection fails, logs available channel names from the provider's guide to help users identify the correct channel selector value for user-defined channels.
  * Improvement: YouTube TV channel matching now handles parenthetical suffix variants and additional PBS affiliate names.
  * Fix: channel selection failures now abort the stream instead of silently serving the wrong channel.
  * Fix: web UI regression.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.3.0 (2026-02-14)
  * New feature: Fox.com provider support.
  * New feature: Sling TV provider support with automatic local affiliate resolution for broadcast networks.
  * New feature: provider filtering. Choose which subscription services are active in your environment and filter channels accordingly.
  * Improvement: streaming startup and playback recovery performance optimizations.
  * Improvement: stream resiliency and recovery improvements.

## 1.2.1 (2026-02-08)
  * New feature: HBO Max provider support.
  * New feature: YouTube TV provider support with automatic local affiliate resolution for broadcast networks and PBS.
  * New feature: proactive page reload for sites with continuous playback limits (e.g., NBC.com).
  * Fix: false positive dead capture detection on lower quality presets causing continuous tab replacement loops.
  * Housekeeping.

## 1.2.0 (2026-02-07)
  * New feature: Homebrew tap for macOS installation (`brew install hjdhjd/prismcast/prismcast`). Upgrade it like any Homebrew package after that.
  * New feature: Automated Docker builds based on the contributions of @bnhf. Latest official release can always be installed from: `docker pull ghcr.io/hjdhjd/prismcast:latest`.
  * New feature: Hulu support.
  * Improvement: DisneyNOW, Hulu, Sling, and additional channels and providers added.
  * Improvement: The channels tab has been rethought to handle multiple provider types. Now you can decide which provider you'd like to use for which channel, or override them all with a user-defined channel if you prefer. **Note: I would strongly encourage users to embrace the defaults and not create user-defined channels unless they are necessary in your environment. The predefined channels represent what is tested and will be maintained. If you've defined channels previously that are now built into PrismCast, I would encourage you to streamline your environment and delete the user-defined channel and use the appropriate builtin version. You don't have to do this...but it will make your quality of life better as PrismCast evolves and your user-defined channels don't keep up with PrismCast's updates.**
  * Improvement: UI refinements.
  * Behavior change: native capture mode is now disabled due to a Chrome bug that produces corrupt output after a few minutes. Hopefully Chrome addresses this in the future and I can make this available again.
  * Housekeeping.
